## 技巧总结

1. 可以使用电脑一句一句的录出来，然后听再改进。一个章节这样走完以后再进行全部章节的朗读。甚至一句一句练习的时候还可以根据原版录音来对比。
2. 要收集句子量和段落的量。把汉语写出来，进行英文背诵。最后直至彻底脱稿而出。不要傻傻的背单词，要背句子和阅读长文章。这个过程中遇到不会的单词和语法，然后再进行收集。
3. 不要求快。一个句子要挨个单词发音标准，该重读的重读，该快的快（首先要每个音都要发出来，这个是基础）。要把音发标准。读句子的时候要思考，这个句子的短句应该怎么断句，连读应该怎么连读。
4. 对着汉语回想英语句子的时候，一定要使用笔来同时来进行书写。这样看起来速度是很慢的，但是效果是很好的。
5. 英语发音的关键（元音要饱满，这样才好听）
6. 英语句子模仿的时候要关注老外的哪些地方轻读和吞音等。然后再模仿。
7. 一开始就要模仿连读，连读的多了就能听懂老外讲的东西了。自己也能进行连读了。
8. 一定要突破英语，如果自己的口语过关，自己的能力将会发挥的更极致。

感想

> 学习一门语言要听说读写，而且要给自己足够多的时间来进行操练和练习。
>
> 听：可以根据外教的发音来让大脑回忆出来，这个单词和句子的音标（包括重读的位置也要标记和着重感知），甚至自己还可以写出来。
>
> 听：既然可能通过听来识别音标，那么自己也可以通过听来回想这个单词是如何拼写的。
>
> 读：读的第一步就是先回想下这个单词或者句子的音标是什么样，重读的位置在哪里？ 第一遍先回想起来音标再读，甚至可以一个一个单词的读，第二遍，第三遍可以加快读，或者连读。 读的时候不要拖沓，该长的长，该短的短。
>
> 写：需要阅读大量的英文资料，然后自己使用英文来编写内容。

读的时候不要要求快，先要保证自己的发音是正确的。

> 刚开始可以对照着英文单词（不含有音标的）读，后面可以根据汉语来读写英文。 全方位练习，并且遇到发音不准确的，要记录下来。以供自己反复修正，直到纠正正确为止。
>
> 如果自己听的录音足够的多，自己甚至还可以再读英文之前，就能在脑子里面回想出来这个词的发音。
