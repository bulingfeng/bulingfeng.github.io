感想

> 学习一门语言要听说读写，而且要给自己足够多的时间来进行操练和练习。
>
> 听：可以根据外教的发音来让大脑回忆出来，这个单词和句子的音标（包括重读的位置也要标记和着重感知），甚至自己还可以写出来。
>
> 听：既然可能通过听来识别音标，那么自己也可以通过听来回想这个单词是如何拼写的。
>
> 读：读的第一步就是先回想下这个单词或者句子的音标是什么样，重读的位置在哪里？ 第一遍先回想起来音标再读，甚至可以一个一个单词的读，第二遍，第三遍可以加快读，或者连读。 读的时候不要拖沓，该长的长，该短的短。
>
> 写：需要阅读大量的英文资料，然后自己使用英文来编写内容。

读的时候不要要求快，先要保证自己的发音是正确的。

> 刚开始可以对照着英文单词（不含有音标的）读，后面可以根据汉语来读写英文。 全方位练习，并且遇到发音不准确的，要记录下来。以供自己反复修正，直到纠正正确为止。
>
> 如果自己听的录音足够的多，自己甚至还可以再读英文之前，就能在脑子里面回想出来这个词的发音。
