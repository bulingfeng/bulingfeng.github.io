Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve may make you anxious, but not thinking about them (and hence not dealing with them) should make you more anxious still. When a problem stems from your own lack of talent or skill, most people feel shame. Get over it. I cannot emphasize this enough: Acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them. It's the first step toward overcoming them. The pains you are feeling are "growing pains" that will test your character and reward you as you push through them.

> Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look at.
