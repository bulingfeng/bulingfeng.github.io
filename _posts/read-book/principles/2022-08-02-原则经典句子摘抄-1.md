1. Without principles we would be forced to react to all the things life throws at us individually, as if we were experiencing each of them situations into types and have good principles for dealing with them, we will make better decisions more quickly and have better lives as a result.
2. 必须梳理自己的原则，比如在健康上自己应该保持哪些原则，自己发展上应该保持哪些原则，读书应该保持哪些原则，学习应该保持哪些原则，工作应该保持哪些原则，投资上应该保持哪些原则。好的书就要一生都要读，时不时拿来读一读，因为它价值是足够大的，希望自己能够做到。对好书要多读，垃圾书直接扔掉。
3. Do we have common principles that bind us together -- as as family, as a community, as a nation, as friends across nations? Or do we have opposing principles that divide us? What are they?
4. While it isn't necessarily a bad thing to use other's principles, adopting principles without giving them much thought can expose you to the risk of acting in ways inconsistent with your goals and your nature.
5. 为何大多数人过的并不好？可能是因为他们从来没有仔细思考自己该如何做才能好好生活。
6. Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve.
7. People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts.
8. The worst thing you can be is a phony, because if you're a phony you will lose people's trust and your own selfrespect. So you must be clear about your principles and then you must "walk the talk".
